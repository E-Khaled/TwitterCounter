*
All alphabets, punctuations, numbers, and symbols are all a single character. For example, @ takes up one character on X. Even alphabets from Western European languages, like √á or √ú, also carry the same weight. A space is also a single character. So, how many characters are there in this sentence? Counting every alphabet, the spaces between each word, the question, and the comma, it is 51. As there are eight words, there are eight spaces. So, if you remove the spaces, it is 43.
There are also characters that account for two units instead of one. Emojis, which people tend to use instead of words, fall into this category. If you look at certain emojis, you‚Äôll notice they combine two or more emojis like üë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶. Even in this case, using üë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ counts for two characters, not three.
The platform assigns this value to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages. This reduces the maximum character limit from 280 to 140 and 25,000 to 12,500 for subscribers.
You may include other things in a post that don‚Äôt fit these categories. A link, regardless of the length, will always be 23 characters. Photos, GIFs, and videos don‚Äôt take up any characters. If you mention a user, the platform counts the number of characters in the username, along with the @ symbol. As a handle cannot exceed 15 characters, it won‚Äôt take more than 16 characters.*
*
* so as a counclution :
* normal characters = 1
* emoji =2
* Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages = 2
* links = 23
